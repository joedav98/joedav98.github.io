      <h3 id = "heading1">About me</h3>
      <p> I am a diligent and enthusiastic worker.
        I enjoy helping others, and seeing their joy and satisfaction.
        I am skilled in solving problems in a resourceful manner,
        and I enjoy logical problem-solving. I am a good listener and learner,
        able to communicate well with a group and on an individual level. </p>

    <div id = "Qualifications" class = "tabcontent">
      <h3 id = "heading1"> My Education </h3>
      <p> In my diploma studies, I studied the fundamentals of Mechanical, Electrical and Electronic engineering with programming. I learnt to conceptualize, design, draft, fabricate and thereafter code different machines and robots. Out of all the different required modules, I excelled best at coding and programming. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of problem solving, and the logic behind programming.
      <br><br>In my 2nd year, I volunteered to join the solar car team, known as SunSPEC. It was a multi-disciplinary project that aimed to send a solar powered car to join in the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a 3000km race through Australia, from Darwin to Adelaide. Within this project, the team had to endure many hardships, from unreasonable supervisors, to difficult teammates, but we all got through in the end. Ultimately, I must say that this project has made all of us better people.
      <br><br>I graduated from my course on the 7th of May 2018, with a cumulative GPA of 3.753. My perseverance in my studies paid off, and I was awarded the Directorâ€™s Honor Roll for 2 of my academic years.
